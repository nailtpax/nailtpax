# Hi everyone!

I'm an offensive security professional in constant improvement. Currently working as a mid-level pentester, engaged in Black Box projects (Web/Infra/Wi-Fi/Mobile) and Red Team operations.

## Objective
Enhancing my programming skills to deeply understand the internal workings of applications and systems, aiming to explore advanced malware research techniques for **defensive purposes** — strengthening threat detection and mitigation while developing more secure solutions. I’m particularly interested in **reverse engineering**, **defense evasion**, and **malware analysis**.

## Core Skills
- **Languages:** Python, C, Bash, and PowerShell (currently studying)  
- **Environments:** Web, Infrastructure, Wi-Fi, and Mobile  
- **Testing types:** Black Box, Gray Box, and White Box  

## Projects
- **keyhunter** — lightweight Python script to identify and collect keys/tokens from HTML pages.  
- **desec-pentest-scripts** — collection of scripts and utilities developed during the Desec Pentest course.

## Responsible Use
All projects here are intended for **research, defense, and educational** purposes only. **Do not** use them for malicious activities. If you discover vulnerabilities, please follow responsible disclosure practices.
